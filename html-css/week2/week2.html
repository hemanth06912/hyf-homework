            <div>
            <P>Examples of dramatic transformation in communication 
                 and commerce led by web development include e-com-
                 merce. Online auction sites such as e-bay as changed
                 the way consumers find and purchase goods and servic-
                 es. Online retailers such as Amazon.com and Buy.com 
                 (among many others) have transformed the shopping 
                 and bargain-hunting experience for many customers.

           <h2>PRACTICAL WEB DEVELOPMENT</h2> </div>
           <div>
           <P>Modern day web browsing has come a long way since the 90’s.
            Do you remember web surfing on your dial up internet and
       
            coming across every other website using really cheesy 
            flash animations like spinning 3-d logos or mouse trails?
            I certainly do.</P>

            <p>Now that flash is being pushed out of the scope of things 
            (firefox recently announced that it will prevent flash from
            working in its browser) developers are starting to use an 
            HTML element called Canvas. It has adopted some of the better
            features from flash and is being used widely in the front-end
            development community for creating interactive graphics,
            videos, and games that run in the browser.
              </p>
            <p>Canvas uses scripting, such as JavaScript, to render graphics.
            It is currently supported by all recent versions of all major
            browsers and by most (currently 95%) of all active versions
            of those browsers. Canvases are very simple to create. The
            only HTML needed is a simple tag. There are no required 
            attributes. If you are worried about supporting all browsers
            you can put a fallback element inside of this tag for older
            browsers to read when they can’t use canvas.For our project,
            we will be making two canvases. One for our reference image
            and the other for our graphics. In this example we will give
            both elements id attributes to allow easy implementation of
            JavaScript. You can also set an inline width and height in
            the attributes, which is recomended when going smaller than
            the window size, but for the purposes of this demo our 
            project will be set to the window’s width and height.</p>
